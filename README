My Battery Pickup API is written in Go since that is my most efficient language at the moment. Go is not required to run the server; simply run the compiled binary by executing `./server`. The binary was built for MacOS, so there may be issues if your host machine is not MacOS/Linux. If Go is installed (highly recommended, it's a fun language), you can start the server with `go run *.go` from within the redwood-take-home directory.

Once the server is running, you can execute `./test.sh` which will submit API requests to the server running at http://localhost:8080 and output responses. The test script uses `jq` to extract the pickup request id from the response, so that will need to be installed if not already. 

The test script:
- checks for server liveness by hitting the base path
- posts new rules to the server
- gets the pricing rules
- posts a new pickup request
- gets the new pickup request by id
- accepts the given quote for the pickup request (via a PATCH)
- returns all existing pickup requests
- returns all existing pickup requests that have been accepted

I would have liked to create a swagger document for the API, but it was taking a little too much time to complete. Otherwise it would have been included.
